"INV506","Chalk talk","500","Known Unknowns: Bayesian Multi-Path Framework for Uncertainty in LLMs","This session presents a novel Bayesian framework for quantifying uncertainty in enterprise large language models through multi-perspective reasoning. We demonstrate how combining Bradley-Terry probability models with PageRank algorithms enables systematic decomposition of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty patterns. Our approach automatically triggers appropriate enhancement strategies—retrieval augmentation, tool calling, or foundation model responses—based on uncertainty thresholds. Our approach transforms uncertainty from a limitation into actionable intelligence, enabling data-driven decisions about model customization and knowledge integration. Discover how enterprises can use uncertainty patterns to optimize retrieval strategies, reduce computational costs, and improve model reliability in mission-critical applications. Attendees receive practical implementation guidance for production deployments.","Jae Oh Woo; baishali chaudhury","Mandalay Bay","Tuesday 16:00 - 17:00","Amazon Bedrock; Amazon SageMaker AI","Generative AI; Responsible AI; Cost Optimization; Artificial Intelligence; Academic / Researcher; Data Scientist; Solution / Systems Architect; Interactive","https://registration.awsevents.com/flow/awsevents/reinvent2025/event-catalog/page/eventCatalog/session/1755023386999001lojs"

"SAS305","Breakout session","300","Using GenAI to profile, scale, and optimize your multi-tenant SaaS architecture","SaaS builders have always relied heavily on metrics and profiling data to assess the real-time profile of their SaaS architecture. How efficiently the system is consuming resources, how tenants are applying loads, where noisy neighbor conditions are surfacing—these are amongst a long list of insights that SaaS architects rely on. This session will look at how GenAI can be brought to this experience, enabling builders to get richer views into how their multi-tenant strategies and policies are working. GenAI opens all new paths into interrogating the footprint of a SaaS environment, including analyzing key experience insights (time to value, throttling patters, over-provisioning, etc.). The goal is to look at how/where these GenAI mechanisms can be introduced into your architecture and how they can be analyzed with various GenAI tools.","Dave Roberts; Dhammika Sriyananda","MGM","Monday 17:30 - 18:30","Amazon Bedrock","SaaS; Agentic AI; DevOps; Architecture; Artificial Intelligence; Developer / Engineer; Solution / Systems Architect; Developer Community; Lecture-style","https://registration.awsevents.com/flow/awsevents/reinvent2025/event-catalog/page/eventCatalog/session/1753399805090001Kzr2"
